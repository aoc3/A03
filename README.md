Tutorial on how to use Github:

1. Create a new repository - In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click "+" and then select New repository. Name your repository hello-world. Write a short description. Select Initialize this repository with a README.

2. Create a branch - Go to your new repository hello-world. Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master. Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box. Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

3. Make and commit changes - Click the README.md file. Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit. In the editor, write a bit about yourself. Write a commit message that describes your changes. Click Commit changes button.

4. Open a Pull Request - Click the  Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button. In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with master (the original). Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit. Click the big green Create Pull Request button. Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request.

5. Merge a Pull Request - Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master. Click Confirm merge. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
